# akamai-api-postman-collections
The Akamai APIs can be easily used with Postman. Postman relies on Collections to store requests and Environments to store variables. These files will contain both a Postman Collection and Postman Environment for several Akamai APIs.

Utilizing best practices for variables and authentication, you can use these files to import into Postman.

Requirements:
- Have Postman installed
- Have an Akamai API Client with valid API credentials and permissions to the API.

Instructions:
- In Postman, click on Import,
- Select or drag-and-drop the Collection and Environment files,
- Click Submit,
- Select your Environment,
- Click on the Eye icon and click Edit,
- Add your Akamai API credentials (host, access_token, client_token, client_secret),
- You can now run the requests.
